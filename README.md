# Business Problem Optimization Using Linear Programming (PuLP)

## 📌 Internship Task – 4 (CODTECH)

This project demonstrates how **optimization techniques**, specifically **Linear Programming (LP)**, can be applied to solve real-world **business and supply chain problems** using **Python and the PuLP library**.

Unlike traditional Machine Learning projects that rely on historical data, this project focuses on **decision optimization under constraints**.

---

## 📖 Project Overview

The notebook covers **two major optimization use cases**:

1. **Manufacturing Profit Maximization**
2. **Supply Chain Transportation Cost Minimization**

Both problems are modeled mathematically and solved using **Linear Programming**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand business problems from an optimization perspective
- Formulate objective functions and constraints
- Implement Linear Programming using Python
- Use PuLP to obtain optimal solutions
- Interpret results and extract business insights
- Visualize optimized supply chain flows

## 🧩 Problem 1: Manufacturing Profit Maximization

### Business Scenario
A manufacturing company produces two products:
- Product A
- Product B

Each product consumes machine hours and labor hours, which are limited.
The goal is to determine the optimal production quantities that **maximize total profit**.

### Optimization Type
- **Objective:** Maximize profit
- **Technique:** Linear Programming
- **Decision Variables:** Units of Product A and Product B
- **Constraints:** Machine hours, labor hours, non-negativity

---

## 📦 Problem 2: Supply Chain Optimization

### Business Scenario
A company operates:
- 2 Warehouses
- 3 Retail Stores

Each warehouse has limited supply capacity, and each store has fixed demand.
Transportation costs vary between warehouse–store pairs.

### Optimization Type
- **Objective:** Minimize transportation cost
- **Technique:** Linear Programming
- **Decision Variables:** Units shipped from each warehouse to each store
- **Constraints:** Supply limits, demand fulfillment

## 📊 Visualization

The optimized supply chain solution is visualized to:
- Show shipment routes
- Display flow quantities
- Improve interpretability of optimization results

Visualization helps bridge the gap between **technical solutions and business decision-making**.
